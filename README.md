# ArrayProtocol-ArrayWrapper
This repo contains an ArrayProtocol, and an ArrayWrapper to emulate the Array in Swift. Thus you can subclass an "Array" easily.

There are 3 array-like type in Swift 4 stdlib, Array, ArraySlice and ContiguousArray.

So I made ArrayLikeProtocol to conclude these three types.

And Array conforms Encodable and Decodable, so there is a special ArrayProtocol conforms these two.

Enjoy.
